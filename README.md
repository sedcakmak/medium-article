# Medium-Article
This project is done as a part of the Medium Copycat Challenge of LeWagon Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to copy a Medium Article. However, I experimented with several issues which were not 
required by the original challenge.

* I paid more attention to responsive web design. It's now scaling nicely on other devices. This was my first time using media queries, so I studied a lot before implementing it.

* I experimented with the :before and :after pseudo-classes and implemented them successfully.

* I also experimented with the blockquote element with a nice styling of quotation marks. I commented it out as it messed up the rest of my code. 
<blockquote> And now accidentally I found out we can use it here too! ;) </blockquote>
