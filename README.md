# Medium-Article
This project is done as a part of the Medium Copycat Challenge of LeWagon Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to copy a Medium Article. However, I experimented with several issues which were not 
required by the original challenge.

* I paid more attention to responsive web design. It's now scaling nicely on other devices. This was my first time using media queries, so I studied a lot before implementing it.

* I experimented with the :before and :after pseudo-classes and implemented them successfully.

* I also experimented with the blockquote element with a nice styling of quotation marks. I commented it out as it messed up the rest of my code.

## The problems I couldn't solve (yet):

On mobile, the banner takes much more space than the original challenge. I tried giving different heights, but couldn't solve it effectively. It doesn't look ugly, so I left it as it is:)
Also, I wanted to blur the background image of the banner so that the text will be more visible. Apparently there wasn't an easy way to do this. (I may need to add another div and
separate the image from the texts to do this.)
